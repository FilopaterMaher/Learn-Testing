pip install pytest

to make test function you must start with test_

to run all your test functions run the pytest command in your directory
to run tests in specific file pytest file_name.py

assert is any thing you can make it in conditional case

if you make tests for all parts in the function that called the full coverage test

Use @pytest.fixture if there is something common in function to make your code no violate DRY principles
